### [DanhoCustomBadges](/dist/bd/DanhoCustomBadges.plugin.js) <sub><sup>`v.0.0.2` *(Updated: 27/05/2022)*</sup></sub>
Add your own custom badges to your or other people's profile.

> **Features to implement**
> * File upload in settings so it's not only reliant on urls
> * Badge context menu to edit badge directly in the app
> * Badge references, so you can add the same badge to multiple users instead of creating the same badge over and over
>
> * Verified server owners get a "Verified" badge
> * Partner/Verified badges clicked redirects to server invite
>
> * Settings Collapse containers

> **Bugs**
> * Doesn't always find UserProfileModalHeader on load, therefore not working
> * Settings aren't showing custom badges - thanks to UserProfileBadgeList for not working anymore >.>
> * Custom badges don't load in UserSettings - also thanks to UserProfileBadgeList for not working anymore
