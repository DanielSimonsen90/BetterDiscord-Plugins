# [VisualRefreshFixes v1.0.0](https://github.com/DanielSimonsen90/BetterDiscord-Plugins/dist/bd/VisualRefreshFixes)
by danhosaur

## What does it do?
Fix some of the visual-refresh issues like:
- Uneven channelTextArea with UserArea panel
- Guild icons not being completely round
- Discord navigations like friends, nitro and store taking up unnecessary amount of space compared to direct messages
- Buttons being too rounded

All of these "issues" can be managed by the plugin settings.
