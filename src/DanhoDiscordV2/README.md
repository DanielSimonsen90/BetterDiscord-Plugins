### [DanhoDiscordV2](/dist/bd/DanhoDiscordV2.plugin.js) <sub><sup>`v.0.0.1` *(Updated: 20/05/2022)*</sup></sub>
General small Discord changes to my liking. So far only includes:
* BetterRoles
  - Hiding roleCircle from the DOM
  - Color role background with slight opacity

**Features to implement**
> * Role Groups to group roles in a container using REGEX on the role's name
> * MoreDiscordPages to add more Discord pages to the Guild list
> - Add support for custom components?
