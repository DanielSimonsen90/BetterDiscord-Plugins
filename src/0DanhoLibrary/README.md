### [DanhoLibrary](/dist/bd/0DanhoLibrary.plugin.js) <sub><sup>`v.1.0.0` *(Updated: 07/08/2022)*</sup></sub>
Library module working with discordium, taking advantage of Zerebos' ZerebosLibrary/ZLibrary & DevilBro's BDFDB + additional personal features.

#### Features
* Global API
    - Everything available through discordium, danho-discordium or native Discord modules are available through global BDD API - window.BDD

> **Todo**
> * Update branch to latest version of Zerthox' original repo

> **Bugs**
> * Doesn't work as multiple references to BDD or BDFDB, when properties aren't created on window. Fixed with work-around that spams conosle & BdApi toasts.
